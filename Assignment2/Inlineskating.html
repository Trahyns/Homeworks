            <h2>My first experience going to Galaxy Skating Rink</h2>
            <p class="sectionIntro">I loved watching people of all ages gliding across the oval-shaped rink to music hits of that time. The entire <em>atmosphere</em> was fun! Being very eager to learn, I grabbed my first pair of quad skates and headed towards the rink.</p>

                <ol class="list">
                    <li>Quickly grabbed onto the wall</li>
                    <li>My legs were wobbly, like a baby bird learning how to walk for the first time</li>
                    <li>Bent my knees--following what I saw the other skaters doing</li>
                    <li>Fell on my butt as soon as picked up some speed</li>
                    <li><strong>Got right back up again</strong>, and quickly became comfortable with skating</li>

                <li>I was afraid</li>

            <p class="sectionIntro">It wasn't until after I made a new friend recently, I was motivated to purchase my first pair of inline skates. He mentioned how much fun it was to skate with his pair, and that I should really try them out.</p>

            <p class="sectionIntro">With everything that is happening in the world today--COVID-19, forcing everyone to quarantine. I really was looking forward to learning a new hobbie. Especially, since I was stuck working from home, sitting behind a desk all day 5 days a
                week. I could'nt wait to try them for a spin!</p>

            <p class="sectionIntro">My parents wished me good luck, when I left to meet with my friend to learn how to skate. At first step, I felt like I was going to roll away and never stop. I had got the balance down packed, but trying to turn was a bit tricky. I almost
                fell numerous times too! Hahaha! But luckily, I had my good friend by my side to catch me.</p>

            <p class="sectionIntro">I had no safety gear at the moment, except for wrist guards. I promised my dad I would invest in a helmet, along with knee and elbow pads.</p>

            <p id="last">I was told after my skating session that I did a great job! Didn't fall, and held my balance. Whew! that was a true core workout! I am definitely looking forward to skating again.</p>
